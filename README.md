                    <br><br><strong><u>🐱 Recommendations :</u></strong><hr><ul>
                    <li> Since the Basic plan is most popular overall, Netflix can design bundle offers or loyalty rewards around the Basic tier to encourage long-term retention.
                    <li> As Standard is more preferred in Mexico & UK, Netflix should focus promotions, regional discounts, and targeted ads on the Standard plan to maximize growth and maintain its popularity.
                    <li> With Premium being strong in Spain and France, Netflix can promote family/group sharing features, UHD content, and exclusive releases to further strengthen Premium adoption.
                    <li> Adapt localized pricing strategies based on plan popularity (e.g., competitive pricing for Premium in Spain/France, attractive Standard deals in Mexico/UK).
                    <li> Invest in region-specific exclusive content (movies/series) to match the user segment that dominates each plan type and increase retention.
                    <li> In Mexico and the UK, where the Premium plan is less preferred, Netflix should offer **limited-time discounts or free trial upgrades** to attract users and showcase the added value of Premium features.
